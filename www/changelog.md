* Flatten global translations (#105)

    The global translations (goals, targets, and indicators) have changed from a "nested" structure to a flat structure. For example, instead of the previous structure of:

    ```
    '1':
      short: Keine Armut
      title: Armut in allen ihren Formen und überall beenden
    ```

    ```
