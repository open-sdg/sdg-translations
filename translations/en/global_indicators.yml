    to 105 receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where
    cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should be possible
    for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an average cost of
    5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in each
    corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements

  definition: The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and

    genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide.
    Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding
    programmes as well, even directly on-farm.  The measure of trends in ex situ conserved
    materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing
    to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use
    and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur
    in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm.  The two components of the indicator,
    plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted.  Plant genetic resources  The plant
    component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources
    secured in sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in
    a genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture

    at its Fourteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf).   Animal
    genetic resources  The animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds
    stored within a genebank collection with an amount of genetic material stored
    which is required to reconstitute the breed (based on the Guidelines on Cryconservation

  definition: Harmful use of alcohol, defined according to the national context as
    alcohol per capita consumption (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar year
    in litres of pure alcohol  Total alcohol per capita consumption (APC) is defined
    as the total (sum of recorded APC three-year average and unrecorded APC as a proportion
    of total) amount of alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years) over a calendar year,
    in litres of pure alcohol, adjusted for tourist consumption. Recorded alcohol
    consumption refers to official statistics at country level (production, import,
    export, and sales or taxation data), while the unrecorded alcohol consumption
    refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental
    control, such as home or informally produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled
    alcohol, surrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not intended for human consumption),
    or alcohol obtained through cross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different
    jurisdiction). Tourist consumption takes into account tourists visiting the country
    and inhabitants visiting other countries. Positive figures denote alcohol consumption
    of outbound tourists being greater than alcohol consumption by inbound tourists,
    negative numbers the opposite. Tourist consumption is based on UN statistics,
    and data are provided by IHME.

  custodian_agency: UN Environment, (United Nations Environment Programme)
  definition: The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country
    that have good ambient water quality. Ambient water quality refers to natural,
    untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination
    of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities.
    The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and
    the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality
    is assessed by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural
    water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with
    major impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters
    is economically unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status
    of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake
    and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment
    and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The
    quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance
    of the available water quality monitoring data for the core parameters with target
    values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of
    the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least
    80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a
    percentage.

    To address its complexity, Indicator 6.6.1 has been divided into 5 Sub-Indicators
    to capture the various data sources and methodologies required for monitoring
    components of the Indicator. Data sources come from a combination of ground sampling
    and earth observations. Depending on the type of ecosystem and the type of extent
    being measured, the data collection methodology can also differ greatly. A progressive
    monitoring approach with two levels is proposed:  Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based
    on globally available data from earth observations which will be validated by
    countries against their own methodologies and datasets:   Sub-Indicator 1  spatial
