    Prices Worldwide database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending
    to 105 receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where
    cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should be possible
    for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an average cost of
    5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in each
    corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements

    and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural
    resources. Social and economic values of forests are reconciled with environmental
    values through sustainable management plans. The sub-indicator provides further

  definition: The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and
    agriculture (GRFA) in medium or long term conservation facilities (ex situ in
    genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide.
    Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding
    programmes as well, even directly on-farm.  The measure of trends in ex situ conserved
    materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing
    to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use
    and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur
    in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm.  The two components of the indicator,
    plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted.  Plant genetic resources  The plant
    component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources
    secured in sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in
    a genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture
    (accessible at http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/),
    set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving
    plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for
    the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards
    have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture
    at its Fourteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf).   Animal
    genetic resources  The animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds
    stored within a genebank collection with an amount of genetic material stored
    which is required to reconstitute the breed (based on the Guidelines on Cryconservation
    of Animal Genetic Resources, FAO, 2012, accessible at http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm).

  definition: The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country

    untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination
    of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities.
    The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and
    the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality
    is assessed by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural
    water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with
    major impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters
    is economically unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status
    of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake
    and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment
    and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The
    quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance
    of the available water quality monitoring data for the core parameters with target
    values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of
    the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least
    80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a

  definition: The frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries provide
    information on the number of cases of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury
    per hours worked by the concerned population during the reference period. It is
    a measure of the risk of having a fatal or a non-fatal occupational injury based
    on the duration of exposure to adverse work-related factors.  The incidence rates
    of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries provide information on the number
    of cases of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury per workers in the reference
    group during the reference period. It is a measure of the personal likelihood
    of the workers in the reference group of suffering from work-related injuries.  For
    the purposes of international reporting on the SDG indicators, incidence rates
    are used, even though the indicator title of 8.8.1 calls for the use of frequency
    rates, as common practices around the world and data availability favour incidence
    rates.

    countries.  Data are collected from Transport Ministries, statistical offices
    and other institution designated as official data source. Although there are clear
    definitions for all the terms used in this survey, countries might have different
    methodologies to calculate tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods
    could be based on traffic or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods
    and estimating techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics.  ITF

    the whole economy (total CO2 emissions/GDP) or for specific sectors, notably the
    manufacturing sector (CO2 emissions from manufacturing industries per manufacturing
    value added (MVA).   CO2 emissions per unit of GDP are expressed in kilogrammes
